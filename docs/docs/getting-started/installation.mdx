# Installation

Lists all the available options for installing/building Fetcharr. Some of these might not be supported by us, but we might still be able to help!

:::warning

**Fetcharr is still early in development.** If you would like to help test the bleeding edge, please use the image `fetcharr/fetcharr:develop`!

:::

## Docker

:::warning

Be sure to replace `/path/to/appdata/config` with a valid host directory path. If the path is invalid, Fetcharr will not be able to start the container properly.

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker-cli" label="Docker CLI" default>
    To start Fetcharr with Docker CLI, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -d \
        --name fetcharr \
        -e TZ=Europe/Copenhagen \
        -v /path/to/appdata/config:/config \
        --restart unless-stopped \
        fetcharr/fetcharr:latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    For a declarative approach to starting Fetcharr, you can use Docker Compose, like so:

    ```yaml title="compose.yaml"
    services:
        fetcharr:
            image: fetcharr/fetcharr:latest
            container_name: fetcharr
            environment:
            - TZ=Europe/Copenhagen
            volumes:
            - /path/to/appdata/config:/config
            restart: unless-stopped
    ```

    Then, to start Fetcharr:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## From source

:::danger

While building the project from source can be useful for trying out bleeding-edge features, **it is not recommended for production use.**

:::

First, clone down the repository and checkout the branch you'd like to build:

```bash
git clone -b BRANCH_NAME https://github.com/fetcharr/fetcharr
```

Afterwards, build the Docker image using [NUKE](https://nuke.build):

```bash
./build.cmd BuildImage # or `nuke BuildImage`, if you have it installed
```

:::info

You don't need to have NUKE installed for `build.cmd` to work.
